  Dialogues:
  - The samples you brought last week are still being analyzed, but the results seems
    promising!
  - 'Really? What have we got so far? '
  - It seems we are dealing with some kind of parasite. Which is odd because it looks
    like it has... A brain.
  - "A parasite with a brain? Hmm\u2026"
  - We've sent all the documentation we have so far to our team back on Earth. They
    said they'll be sending their conclusion about what we have tomorrow.
  - 'Of course, there''s still much more analysis to be done. When we get back to
    Earth we''ll have more tools to study that thing. Anyway... Life outside Earth...
    Pretty cool, huh? '
  - 'I wonder what else this planet is hiding... '
